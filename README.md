## Project Abstract
Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of natural disasters worldwide, ravaging ecosystems, economies, and societies. This project examines the relationship between long-term climate trends and natural disaster patterns using three complementary datasets: Earth Surface Temperature, Natural Disasters (1900–2021), and Natural Disasters NASA (2002–2025). Together, these datasets provide both historical and contemporary perspectives, mapping global temperature fluctuations to disaster occurrences such as floods, storms, droughts, and wildfires.
The primary objective of the project is to analyze correlations between rising surface temperatures and the growing number and intensity of natural disasters by region and decade. Using data-driven methods, cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis in Kaggle notebooks, we will identify temporal trends, visualize geographical hotspots, and investigate causal indicators of extreme weather.

## Project Outcome
This pairing of datasets is particularly suitable for the project since it integrates environmental drivers (temperature anomalies) with event-based impact data over a period of more than a hundred years. The expected outcome is an interactive analytic model and visual dashboard that helps reveal the way climate variables forecast disaster likelihoods. Lastly, this study contributes to climate resilience research since it alerts policymakers and communities to emerging risk locations and the precedence of effective mitigation mechanisms.
